            <h3><b>About Me</b></h3>
            <p>
                    I am Eizler Dylan E. Martin, a student of Lorma Colleges currently enrolled in the course Bachelor of Science in Information Technology(BSIT)
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Interests:</b>
                <br>
                My interests lie in graphic designing, arts and crafts, and music. I enjoy exploring the
                creative aspects of visual and auditory art, which allows me to express myself and appreciate
                the beauty of different forms of creativity. Whether it's designing unique visuals, crafting
                with my hands, or listening to or playing music, these activities inspire me and fuel my
                imagination.
                <br><br>
                <b>Hobbies:</b>
                <br>
                My hobbies include coding, reading books, gaming, and riding my motorcycle. Coding enables me to
                turn ideas into functional solutions, while reading books broadens my knowledge and sparks new
                ideas. Gaming serves as both entertainment and a source of relaxation, and riding my motorcycle
                gives me a sense of freedom and adventure, allowing me to connect with the world around me.
